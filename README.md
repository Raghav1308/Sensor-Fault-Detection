The Air Pressure System(APS) is a critical component of the heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide brakes to the pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benefits of using APS instead of Hydraulic system are the easy avaialability and long-term sustainability.

This is a Binary Classification Problem in which the affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by certain component of APS while the negative class indictaes that the failure was caused by something else.
